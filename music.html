			<h2>Music Overview</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
				While a song itself may be very easy to access and understand for the average person, the idea of making music of the same calliber can seem daunting and inaccessible to those who don't have the experience or schooling. However,
				with the advent of the internet, it is infinitely easier now than it ever has been for anybody to start creating their own music inside their own home or dorm. All you need is a computer, some software, and maybe a microphone, and
				you'll be more than well equipped to create your own tracks.

			<h2>Genres</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
				If you have no idea what kind of music you want to create, picking a genre is often a good place to start. We've listed out some below, but if you don't see any that interest you, don't worry too much. There are so many genres of
				music, each with their own sub-genres and categories that we're sure one will catch your eye.
